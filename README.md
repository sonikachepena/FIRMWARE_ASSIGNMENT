# FIRMWARE_ASSIGNMENT
Here we Develop the code in Arduino to interface an LM35 temperature sensor  with an Arduino Uno and control the onboard LED based on temperature readings.

1. Interface the LM35 temperature sensor with an Arduino Uno.
2. When the temperature falls below 30 degrees Celsius, make the onboard LED
blink every 250 milliseconds.
3. If the temperature rises above 30 degrees Celsius, make the onboard LED blink
every 500 milliseconds.

Here we not supposed to use Millis(), delay() and micros() functions.
